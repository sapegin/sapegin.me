I like BEM. But I’m not Yandex, Google or any other huge company that builds all the internet so I found BEM is too strict for me.

The point of OPOR (One Page of Rules) is that all rules and recommendations are contained on a single page. It combines best parts of [BEM](https://en.bem.info/), [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) and [OOCSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/). It’s not a religion and it’s suitable for any small to medium project.

## CSS classes names

Almost the same style as in BEM. Blocks are `.block`, elements are `.block__elem`, but modifiers are `.block_modifier` instead of `.block_property_value`.

## Cascade usage

Allowed for:

- To define context. E. g. block should look differently on light and dark backgrounds: it can be achieved by using a modifier or using a cascade (adding context class to body tag or to parent block).

```css
.logo {
  color: saddlebrown;
}
.page_about .logo {
  color: ghostwhite;
}
```

- To use semantic classless tags in user-generated content (articles, comments, etc.).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
.text ul {}
.text p {}
```

- (Very rarely) when you are sure you will never put nested block with the same tag.

```html
.social-button i { /* Icon */ }
<div class="social-button"><i></i></div>
```

## Mixins

Kind of OOCSS. It’s a normal block but intended to extend another (primary) block, to add some look or behavior.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
.scrollable
a.fake
```

## States

It’s like modifier but you can use it with any block or element. Very useful in JavaScript.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
.is-expanded
.is-visible
.is-highlighted
```

## JS-hooks

You shouldn’t use CSS classes used to style content to select elements in JavaScript. (Except states.)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
.js-files
.js-select
.js-item
```

## Wrappers

Don’t imply any semantics, use it for appearance only.

```html
<div class="header">
  <div class="header-i"></div>
</div>
```

## Caveats

1. Preferred classes order in HTML: blocks, mixins, JS-hooks, states:

```html
<div class="upload-files scrollable js-files is-hidden"></div>
```
