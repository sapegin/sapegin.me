Some people say that testing React components is useless and in many cases it is, but there are a few cases when I think it’s useful:

- component libraries,
- open source projects,
- integration with third-party components,
- bugs, to prevent regressions.

I’ve tried many tools and finally have found a combination that I like enough to suggest to other developers:

- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), a test runner;
- [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/), a testing utility for React;
- [enzyme-to-json](https://github.com/adriantoine/enzyme-to-json) to convert Enzyme wrappers for Jest snapshot matcher.

For the most of my tests I use shallow rendering with Jest snapshots.

## Shallow rendering

Shallow rendering renders only component itself without its children. So if you change something in a child component it won’t change shallow output of your component. Or a bug, introduced to a child component, won’t break your component’s test. It also doesn’t require DOM.

For example this component:

```jsx
const ButtonWithIcon = ({ icon, children }) => (
  <button>
    <Icon icon={icon} />
    {children}
  </button>
);
```

Will be rendered by React like this:

```html
<button>
  <i class="icon icon_coffee"></i>
  Hello Jest!
</button>
```

But like this with shallow rendering:

```html
<button>
  <Icon icon="coffee" />
  Hello Jest!
</button>
```

Note that the `Icon` component was not rendered.

## Snapshot testing

Jest snapshots are like those old text UIs with windows and buttons made of text characters: it’s a rendered output of your component stored in a text file.

You tell Jest that you want to be sure that output of this component should never change accidentally and Jest saves it to a file that looks like this:

```javascript
exports[`test should render a label 1`] = `
<label
  className="isBlock">
  Hello Jest!
</label>
`;

exports[`test should render a small label 1`] = `
<label
  className="isBlock isSmall">
  Hello Jest!
</label>
`;
```

Every time you change your markup Jest will show you a diff and ask you to update a snapshot if the change was intended.

Jest stores snapshots besides your tests in files like `__snapshots__/Label.spec.js.snap` and you need to commit them with your code.

## Why Jest

- Very fast.
- Snapshot testing.
- Awesome interactive watch mode that reruns only tests that are relevant to your changes.
- Helpful fail messages.
- Simple configuration.
- Mocks and spies.
- Coverage report with a single command-line switch.
- Active development.
- Impossible to write silently wrong asserts like `expect(foo).to.be.a.function` instead of `expect(foo).to.be.a('function')` in Chai because it’s the only natural thing to write after (correct) `expect(foo).to.be.true`.

## Why Enzyme

- Convenient utilities to work with shallow rendering, static rendered markup or DOM rendering.
- jQuery-like API to find elements, read props, and so on

## Setting up

First install all the dependencies including peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest react-test-renderer enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 enzyme-to-json
```

You’ll also need [babel-jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tree/master/packages/babel-jest) for Babel and [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest) for TypeScript.

Update your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest",
  "test:watch": "jest --watch",
  "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
},
"jest": {
  "setupFiles": ["./test/jestsetup.js"],
  "snapshotSerializers": ["enzyme-to-json/serializer"]
}
```

`snapshotSerializers` allows you to pass Enzyme wrappers directly to Jest’s snapshot matcher, without converting them manually by calling enzyme-to-json’s `toJson` function.

Create a `test/jestsetup.js` file to customize Jest environment (see `setupFiles` above):

```javascript
import Enzyme, { shallow, render, mount } from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';

// React 16 Enzyme adapter
Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });

// Make Enzyme functions available in all test files without importing
global.shallow = shallow;
global.render = render;
global.mount = mount;
```

For CSS Modules also add to `jest` section in your `package.json`:

```json
"jest": {
  "moduleNameMapper": {
    "^.+\\.(css|scss)$": "identity-obj-proxy"
  }
}
```

And run `npm install --save-dev identity-obj-proxy`.

Note that [identity-obj-proxy](https://github.com/keyanzhang/identity-obj-proxy) requires `node --harmony-proxies` flag for Node 4 and 5.

## Writing tests

### Testing basic component rendering

That’s enough for most non-interactive components:

```jsx
test('render a label', () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<Label>Hello Jest!</Label>);
  expect(wrapper).toMatchSnapshot();
});

test('render a small label', () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<Label small>Hello Jest!</Label>);
  expect(wrapper).toMatchSnapshot();
});

test('render a grayish label', () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<Label light>Hello Jest!</Label>);
  expect(wrapper).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

### Testing props

Sometimes you want to be more explicit and see real values in tests. In that case use Enzyme API with regular Jest assertions:

```jsx
test('render a document title', () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<DocumentTitle title="Events" />);
  expect(wrapper.prop('title')).toEqual('Events');
});

test('render a document title and a parent title', () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(
    <DocumentTitle title="Events" parent="Event Radar" />
  );
  expect(wrapper.prop('title')).toEqual('Events — Event Radar');
});
```

In some cases you just can’t use snapshots. For example if you have random IDs or something like that:

```jsx
test('render a popover with a random ID', () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<Popover>Hello Jest!</Popover>);
  expect(wrapper.prop('id')).toMatch(/Popover\d+/);
});
```

### Testing events

You can simulate an event like `click` or `change` and then compare component to a snapshot:

```jsx
test('render Markdown in preview mode', () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<MarkdownEditor value="*Hello* Jest!" />);

  expect(wrapper).toMatchSnapshot();

  wrapper.find('[name="toggle-preview"]').simulate('click');

  expect(wrapper).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

Sometimes you want to interact with an element in a child component to test effect in your component. For that you need a proper DOM rendering with Enzyme’s `mount` method:

```jsx
test('open a code editor', () => {
  const wrapper = mount(<Playground code={code} />);

  expect(wrapper.find('.ReactCodeMirror')).toHaveLength(0);

  wrapper.find('button').simulate('click');

  expect(wrapper.find('.ReactCodeMirror')).toHaveLength(1);
});
```

### Testing event handlers

Similar to events testing but instead of testing component’s rendered output with a snapshot use Jest’s mock function to test an event handler itself:

```jsx
test('pass a selected value to the onChange handler', () => {
  const value = '2';
  const onChange = jest.fn();
  const wrapper = shallow(
    <Select items={ITEMS} onChange={onChange} />
  );

  expect(wrapper).toMatchSnapshot();

  wrapper.find('select').simulate('change', {
    target: { value }
  });

  expect(onChange).toBeCalledWith(value);
});
```

### Not only JSX

Jest snapshots work with JSON so you can test any function that returns JSON the same way you test your components:

```jsx
test('accept custom properties', () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(
    <Layout
      flexBasis={0}
      flexGrow={1}
      flexShrink={1}
      flexWrap="wrap"
      justifyContent="flex-end"
      alignContent="center"
      alignItems="center"
    />
  );
  expect(wrapper.prop('style')).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

## Debugging and troubleshooting

### Debugging shallow renderer output

Use Enzyme’s `debug` method to print shallow renderer’s output:

```javascript
const wrapper = shallow(/*~*/);
console.log(wrapper.debug());
```

### Failing tests with enabled coverage

When your tests fail with `--coverage` flag with diff like this:

```diff
-<Button
+<Component
```

Try to replace arrow function component with regular function:

```diff
- export default const Button = ({ children }) => {
+ export default function Button({ children }) {
```

### requestAnimationFrame error

You may see an error like this when you run your tests:

```
console.error node_modules/fbjs/lib/warning.js:42
  Warning: React depends on requestAnimationFrame. Make sure that you load a polyfill in older browsers. http://fb.me/react-polyfills
```

React 16 [depends on `requestAnimationFrame`](https://reactjs.org/docs/javascript-environment-requirements.html), so you need to add [a polyfill](https://github.com/chrisdickinson/raf) to your tests:

```js
// test/jestsetup.js
import 'raf/polyfill';
```
