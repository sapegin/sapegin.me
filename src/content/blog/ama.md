AMA is a GitHub repository where anyone can file an issue with any question and author will reply in a comment. It was [started by Sindre Sorhus](https://blog.sindresorhus.com/answering-anything-678ce5623798) in July 2015 and now there are [more than 100 AMAs](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas).

Some of the questions are [really interesting](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/issues/10). To answer a question one has to write a tiny (and sometimes not so tiny) blog post. For me it’s something between Twitter and a blog, but directed by the readers.

“Watch” someone’s AMA repository and you’ll see all new questions and answers in GitHub feed.

My favorite AMAs:

- [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon/ama)
- [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos/ama)
- [Kent C. Dodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds/ama)
- [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo/ama)
- [Zeno Rocha](https://github.com/zenorocha/ama)
- [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama)
- [Nicholas C. Zakas](https://github.com/nzakas/ama)

[Read answers, ask questions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas#ask-these-people-anything). You can [ask me anything too](https://github.com/sapegin/ama).
