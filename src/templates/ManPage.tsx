					<Heading level={2}>My work preferences</Heading>
					<TextTypo>
						I prefer to work from home. I have a perfect workplace, the best
						coffee in town, catered lunches (by me and my girlfriend). The
						office environment is too distracting, and I get overwhelmed by too
						many things going on around me. Also, being around people all day is
						draining, and the commute on public transport is too stressful for
						me.
					</TextTypo>
					<TextTypo>
						I prefer written asynchronous communication over calls. It allows me
						to reread the question multiple times, think about what to answer,
						edit the text to make it clear, and have your response to reference
						later. I have trouble staying focused during calls and quickly
						forget important details (unless I make notes, which makes it even
						harder to focus).
					</TextTypo>
					<TextTypo>
						Probably, I’ll decline a “quick” call right now or a request to join
						an ongoing meeting. I need time to mentally prepare myself for a
						call.
					</TextTypo>
					<TextTypo>
						I’ll most likely don’t reply to a “hello” or “do you have a minute”
						message in chat. Feel free to write a more actionable message though
						(for example, “can you help me with X”).
					</TextTypo>
					<TextTypo>
						Lunch is sacred, and I have time for lunch blocked every day in my
						calendar. Also, you don’t want to work with me when I’m hangry.
					</TextTypo>
					<TextTypo>I mostly work between 9am and 5pm CET.</TextTypo>
					<TextTypo>
						I’m always “away” in chat. It doesn’t mean I’m not there but don’t
						expect an immediate answer — I often close chat and email to focus
						on work.
					</TextTypo>
					<TextTypo>
						I don’t have any work-related communication tools on my personal
						phone, and I don’t check messages or emails during off-hours.

				<Stack gap="m" as="section">
					<Heading level={2}>I do my best work when</Heading>
					<TextTypo>
						The task isn’t too big or abstract. I struggle to start a task when
						I don’t see an obvious first step.
					</TextTypo>
					<TextTypo>
						I understand why are we doing something, especially regarding the
						processes. If a certain task feels unnecessary or like a waste of
						time, I’d do anything to avoid it.
					</TextTypo>
					<TextTypo>
						I know where things are, meaning all the tools and processes I need
						to do my work are documented and I know where to find them, and
						where to find the docs.
					</TextTypo>
					<TextTypo>I work with one or two people at a time.</TextTypo>

				<Stack gap="m" as="section">
					<Heading level={2}>The best way to give me feedback is</Heading>

						Concrete and immediate but private: I need a specific example of

						I’m happy to meet my team for lunch or anyone for coffee one-on-one
						once in a while but you probably won’t see me in many social
						activities, all-company gatherings, etc.
					</TextTypo>
					<TextTypo>
						The best way of learning for me is by doing. I need to have all the
						docs and information I may need accessible at all times.
					</TextTypo>
					<TextTypo>
						I may seem rude to you — it’s not on purpose, and I’m trying to do
						my best to avoid it. English isn’t my native language, and Russian
						is way more direct.
					</TextTypo>
					<TextTypo>
						If I seem angry, I’m probably very tired, stressed, or overwhelmed.
						Feel free to tell me about it.
					</TextTypo>
					<TextTypo>
						I’m not good at small talk, and I’ll probably be awkwardly quiet
						instead of initiating it.
